<h1>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h1>
<p>Version 3, 29 June 2007</p>
<p>Copyright (C) 2007 <a href="http://fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation, Inc.</a></p>
<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license<br />
document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<h2>Preamble</h2>
<p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and<br />
other kinds of works.</p>
<p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take<br />
away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General<br />
Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all<br />
versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.<br />
We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most<br />
of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its<br />
authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.</p>
<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our<br />
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to<br />
distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you<br />
receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the<br />
software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do<br />
these things.</p>
<p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights<br />
or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain<br />
responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it:<br />
responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p>
<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for<br />
a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received.<br />
You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you<br />
must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
<p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>assert copyright on the software, and</li>
<li>offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute<br />
     and/or modify it.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that<br />
there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake,<br />
the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their<br />
problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.</p>
<p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified<br />
versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This<br />
is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to<br />
change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of<br />
products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most<br />
unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit<br />
the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other<br />
domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future<br />
versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p>
<p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States<br />
should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on<br />
general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special<br />
danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively<br />
proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to<br />
render the program non-free.</p>
<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification<br />
follow.</p>
<h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>
<h3>0. Definitions.</h3>
<p><em>This License</em> refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>
<p><em>Copyright</em> also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works,<br />
such as semiconductor masks.</p>
<p><em>The Program</em> refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.<br />
Each licensee is addressed as <em>you</em>. <em>Licensees</em> and <em>recipients</em> may be<br />
individuals or organizations.</p>
<p>To <em>modify</em> a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a<br />
fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.<br />
The resulting work is called a <em>modified version</em> of the earlier work or a work<br />
<em>based on</em> the earlier work.</p>
<p>A <em>covered work</em> means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the<br />
Program.</p>
<p>To <em>propagate</em> a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,<br />
would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable<br />
copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.<br />
Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),<br />
making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>
<p>To <em>convey</em> a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to<br />
make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer<br />
network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>
<p>An interactive user interface displays <em>Appropriate Legal Notices</em> to the<br />
extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that</p>
<ol>
<li>displays an appropriate copyright notice, and</li>
<li>tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br />
     extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work<br />
     under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a<br />
prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p>
<h3>1. Source Code.</h3>
<p>The <em>source code</em> for a work means the preferred form of the work for making<br />
modifications to it. <em>Object code</em> means any non-source form of a work.</p>
<p>A <em>Standard Interface</em> means an interface that either is an official standard<br />
defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified<br />
for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers<br />
working in that language.</p>
<p>The <em>System Libraries</em> of an executable work include anything, other than the<br />
work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major<br />
Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only<br />
to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard<br />
Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code<br />
form. A <em>Major Component</em>, in this context, means a major essential component<br />
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on<br />
which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an<br />
object code interpreter used to run it.</p>
<p>The <em>Corresponding Source</em> for a work in object code form means all the source<br />
code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object<br />
code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.<br />
However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose<br />
tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in<br />
performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example,<br />
Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source<br />
files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br />
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as<br />
by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and<br />
other parts of the work.</p>
<p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate<br />
automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.</p>
<p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.</p>
<h3>2. Basic Permissions.</h3>
<p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on<br />
the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This<br />
License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified<br />
Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only<br />
if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License<br />
acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by<br />
copyright law.</p>
<p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without<br />
conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey<br />
covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications<br />
exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,<br />
provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all<br />
material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running<br />
the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your<br />
direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br />
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p>
<p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the<br />
conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it<br />
unnecessary.</p>
<h3>3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</h3>
<p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure<br />
under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO<br />
copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or<br />
restricting circumvention of such measures.</p>
<p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br />
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is<br />
effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered<br />
work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the<br />
work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties'<br />
legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.</p>
<h3>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</h3>
<p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it,<br />
in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on<br />
each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that<br />
this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply<br />
to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give<br />
all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>
<p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may<br />
offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>
<h3>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</h3>
<p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it<br />
from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,<br />
provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and<br />
    giving a relevant date.</li>
<li>b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under<br />
    this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement<br />
    modifies the requirement in section 4 to <em>keep intact all notices</em>.</li>
<li>c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to<br />
    anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore<br />
    apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole<br />
    of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This<br />
    License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it<br />
    does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</li>
<li>d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br />
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br />
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need<br />
    not make them do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,<br />
which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not<br />
combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a<br />
storage or distribution medium, is called an <em>aggregate</em> if the compilation and<br />
its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the<br />
compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a<br />
covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br />
parts of the aggregate.</p>
<h3>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</h3>
<p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4<br />
and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source<br />
under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including<br />
    a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source<br />
    fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software<br />
    interchange.</li>
<li>b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including<br />
    a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for<br />
    at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or<br />
    customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the<br />
    object code either<ol>
<li>a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product<br />
   that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium<br />
   customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your<br />
   reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or</li>
<li>access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no<br />
   charge.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written<br />
    offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only<br />
    occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code<br />
    with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.</li>
<li>d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place<br />
    (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding<br />
    Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You<br />
    need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the<br />
    object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the<br />
    Corresponding Source may be on a different server operated by you or a<br />
    third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you<br />
    maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br />
    Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding<br />
    Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as<br />
    needed to satisfy these requirements.</li>
<li>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you<br />
    inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the<br />
    work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection<br />
    6d.</li>
</ul>
<p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the<br />
Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the<br />
object code work.</p>
<p>A <em>User Product</em> is either</p>
<ol>
<li>a <em>consumer product</em>, which means any tangible personal property which is<br />
     normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or</li>
<li>anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.</li>
</ol>
<p>In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be<br />
resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a<br />
particular user, <em>normally used</em> refers to a typical or common use of that<br />
class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way<br />
in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use,<br />
the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product<br />
has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses<br />
represent the only significant mode of use of the product.</p>
<p><em>Installation Information</em> for a User Product means any methods, procedures,<br />
authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute<br />
modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified<br />
version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure<br />
that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case<br />
prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.</p>
<p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br />
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a<br />
transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is<br />
transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of<br />
how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under<br />
this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this<br />
requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the<br />
ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the<br />
work has been installed in ROM).</p>
<p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br />
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a<br />
work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User<br />
Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be<br />
denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the<br />
operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication<br />
across the network.</p>
<p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord<br />
with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an<br />
implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require<br />
no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.</p>
<h3>7. Additional Terms.</h3>
<p><em>Additional permissions</em> are terms that supplement the terms of this License by<br />
making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions<br />
that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were<br />
included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable<br />
law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may<br />
be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains<br />
governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.</p>
<p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any<br />
additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional<br />
permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when<br />
you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added<br />
by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright<br />
permission.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a<br />
covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)<br />
supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of<br />
    sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</li>
<li>b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author<br />
    attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed<br />
    by works containing it; or</li>
<li>c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br />
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable<br />
    ways as different from the original version; or</li>
<li>d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors<br />
    of the material; or</li>
<li>e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade<br />
    names, trademarks, or service marks; or</li>
<li>f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by<br />
    anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with<br />
    contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability<br />
    that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and<br />
    authors.</li>
</ul>
<p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered <em>further restrictions</em><br />
within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any<br />
part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along<br />
with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a<br />
license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or<br />
conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed<br />
by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction<br />
does not survive such relicensing or conveying.</p>
<p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place,<br />
in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to<br />
those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.</p>
<p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a<br />
separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements<br />
apply either way.</p>
<h3>8. Termination.</h3>
<p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided<br />
under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void,<br />
and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any<br />
patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).</p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a<br />
particular copyright holder is reinstated</p>
<ul>
<li>a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br />
    finally terminates your license, and</li>
<li>b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the<br />
    violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated<br />
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some<br />
reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation<br />
of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the<br />
violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.</p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses<br />
of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If<br />
your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not<br />
qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.</p>
<h3>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</h3>
<p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy<br />
of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a<br />
consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does<br />
not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you<br />
permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe<br />
copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or<br />
propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do<br />
so.</p>
<h3>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</h3>
<p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a<br />
license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,<br />
subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by<br />
third parties with this License.</p>
<p>An <em>entity transaction</em> is a transaction transferring control of an<br />
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br />
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work<br />
results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives<br />
a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's<br />
predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a<br />
right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the<br />
predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with<br />
reasonable efforts.</p>
<p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights<br />
granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a<br />
license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this<br />
License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or<br />
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by<br />
making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any<br />
portion of it.</p>
<h3>11. Patents.</h3>
<p>A <em>contributor</em> is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of<br />
the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is<br />
called the contributor's <em>contributor version</em>.</p>
<p>A contributor's <em>essential patent claims</em> are all patent claims owned or<br />
controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,<br />
that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making,<br />
using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would<br />
be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor<br />
version. For purposes of this definition, <em>control</em> includes the right to grant<br />
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this<br />
License.</p>
<p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent<br />
license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell,<br />
offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of<br />
its contributor version.</p>
<p>In the following three paragraphs, a <em>patent license</em> is any express agreement<br />
or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express<br />
permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent<br />
infringement). To <em>grant</em> such a patent license to a party means to make such<br />
an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.</p>
<p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the<br />
Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of<br />
charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available<br />
network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either</p>
<ol>
<li>cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or</li>
<li>arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this<br />
     particular work, or</li>
<li>arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to<br />
     extend the patent license to downstream recipients.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Knowingly relying</em> means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent<br />
license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use<br />
of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable<br />
patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p>
<p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you<br />
convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a<br />
patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing<br />
them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work,<br />
then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients<br />
of the covered work and works based on it.</p>
<p>A patent license is <em>discriminatory</em> if it does not include within the scope of<br />
its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise<br />
of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.<br />
You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a<br />
third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you<br />
make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of<br />
conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br />
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent<br />
license</p>
<ul>
<li>a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies<br />
    made from those copies), or</li>
<li>b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations<br />
    that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or<br />
    that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied<br />
license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to<br />
you under applicable patent law.</p>
<h3>12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</h3>
<p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br />
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse<br />
you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so<br />
as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other<br />
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For<br />
example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for<br />
further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you<br />
could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely<br />
from conveying the Program.</p>
<h3>13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to<br />
link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the<br />
GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey<br />
the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the<br />
part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero<br />
General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network<br />
will apply to the combination as such.</p>
<h3>14. Revised Versions of this License.</h3>
<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU<br />
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in<br />
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems<br />
or concerns.</p>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies<br />
that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License <em>or any later<br />
version</em> applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<br />
conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by<br />
the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number<br />
of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by<br />
the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the<br />
GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of<br />
acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for<br />
the Program.</p>
<p>Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.<br />
However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright<br />
holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.</p>
<h3>15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</h3>
<p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE<br />
LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER<br />
PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM <em>AS IS</em> WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER<br />
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br />
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE<br />
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE<br />
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR<br />
CORRECTION.</p>
<h3>16. Limitation of Liability.</h3>
<p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY<br />
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS<br />
PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,<br />
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE<br />
THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED<br />
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE<br />
PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY<br />
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
<h3>17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</h3>
<p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot<br />
be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall<br />
apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil<br />
liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of<br />
liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.</p>
<h2>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>
<h3>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h3>
<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible<br />
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software<br />
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>
<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach<br />
them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion<br />
of warranty; and each file should have at least the <em>copyright</em> line and a<br />
pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>&lt;one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;

This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.
</code></pre></div>

<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>
<p>If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like<br />
this when it starts in an interactive mode:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>&lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#39;.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type `show c&#39; for details.
</code></pre></div>

<p>The hypothetical commands <code>show w</code> and <code>show c</code> should show the appropriate<br />
parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might<br />
be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an <em>about box</em>.</p>
<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if<br />
any, to sign a <em>copyright disclaimer</em> for the program, if necessary. For more<br />
information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br />
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>.</p>
<p>The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br />
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider<br />
it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If<br />
this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead<br />
of this License. But first, please read<br />
